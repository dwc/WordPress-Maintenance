Introduction
------------

WordPress-Maintenance is a set of scripts designed to simplify
management of WordPress sites across multiple environments. This is
common with development, testing, and production versions of sites.

Two scripts are included:

 * wp_deploy.pl - Deploy WordPress to a specified environment

 * wp_sync_database.pl - Synchronize the WordPress database from one
   environment to another, including uploads

The scripts work based on a local copy of the WordPress files and a
configuration file. This allows you to maintain your WordPress setup
in a version control system, including references to the appropriate
version of WordPress and any plugins. For example, you might have a
Subversion repository containing the following:

wordpress_site_name/
  config.yml
  www/
    [...]
    wp-content/
      [...]
      plugins/
        http-authentication/

The "www" directory can be configured using svn:externals to
automatically check out the required WordPress components.

For an example configuration file, see the perldoc for
WordPress::Maintenance::Config.


Multisite setups
----------------

WordPress multisite setups are supported as of version 0.21. When
installing, you can follow the basic instructions provided by
WordPress:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network

For the WordPress-Maintenance scripts, make sure you've set the
"multisite" flag in your config.yml.

Then, when you initially deploy to an environment, manually disable
the following WordPress network settings in your wp-config.php file:

 * MULTISITE
 * SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL
 * $base
 * DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE
 * PATH_CURRENT_SITE
 * SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE
 * BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE

Just comment out those lines, perform the installation, and then
uncomment them. WordPress uses them to test whether the network has
been installed. If they are enabled before you finish the
installation, WordPress will show errors connecting to the database.

On subsequent deploy operations, the wp-config.php file should work as
filled out by WordPress-Maintenance.
